An acknowledgment also tends to confirm that the statement has been made or the action has been done and so brings about a condition not only of communication but of reality between two or more people. Applause at a theater is an acknowledgment of the actor or act plus approval. Acknowledgment itself does not necessarily apply in approval or disapproval or any other thing beyond the knowledge that an action or statement has been observed and is received. In signaling with the Morse code, the receiver of a message transmits an R to the sender as a signal that the message has been received, which is to say acknowledged. There is such a thing as overacknowledgment and there is such a thing as underacknowledgment. A correct and exact acknowledgment communicates to someone who has spoken that what he has said has been heard. An acknowledgment tends to terminate or end the cycle of a communication and when expertly used can sometimes stop a continued statement or continued action. An acknowledgment is also part of the communication formula and is one of its steps. The actual thing about it is, never in her life had she ever received anybodyâ€™s acknowledgment.

In common English, it might mean a substance put into a compound to improve its qualities or suppress undesirable qualities.

In auditing, administration (abbreviated admin) is also used to denote the action or fact of keeping Auditorâ€™s Reports, Summary Reports, worksheets and other records related to an auditing session. Examples: â€œHe kept good admin,â€ means that his Summary Report, Auditorâ€™s Report and worksheets were neat, exactly on pattern, in proper sequence and easily understood, as well as complete. â€œHis admin was badâ€ means that from the scribble and disorderly keeping of records of the session while it was in progress one could not make out what had happened in the session. You will also see the word admin in connection with the three musts of a well-run organization. It is said that its ethics, tech and admin must be â€œin,â€ which means they must be properly done, orderly and effective. In modern English, when they use the term administration they mean management or running a government, or the group that is in charge of the organization or the state. The word derives from minister, which means to serve. Administer means to manage, govern, arrange financial transactions as a steward or executor; to apply or direct the application of laws or discipline; to conduct or execute religious offices, dispense rights.

It is a precise, thoroughly codified activity with exact procedures. The sets of questions used in auditing are called processes, and â€œprocessingâ€ is another word for auditing.

Any not actually needful auditing command is deleted. For instance, in muzzled auditing, the auditor always says, when the preclear wanders off the subject, â€œI will repeat the auditing commandâ€ and does so. In abridged style, the auditor omits this when it isnâ€™t necessary and just asks the command again if the preclear has forgotten it. By â€œabridgedâ€ is meant getting the exact job doneâ€”the shortest way between two pointsâ€”with no waste questions. â€œIn abridged-style auditing, one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedes case advance.â€ [Lecture 17 Nov. 64; HCOB 6 Nov. 64]'),(NULL,'auditing, all-style',' n. the style of auditing taught and used at Level V and VI, which combines all the lower-level styles, applying the correct style to each situation as it arises in the session.

The auditor has to shift to guiding style to find out what ails the preclear (who probably doesnâ€™t really know), then to listen style while the preclear cognites on a chronic present time problem that just emerged and bothered the preclear, then to direct style to finish the assessment that was in progress. â€œThe only way an auditor can get confused by all style is by not being good at one of the lower-level styles.â€ [Lecture 17 Nov. 64; HCOB 6 Nov. 64]'),(NULL,'auditing assist',' See Dianetic Assist.'),(NULL,'auditing, basic',' n. the part of processing which consists of handling the preclear as a being, the auditing cycle and the meter; called basic auditing because it comes prior to auditing technique.

If the preclear originated, the auditor was permitted to nod only. Later, this was broadened to include TR 4 and allow the auditor to handle preclear originations by simple acknowledgment, without any other question or comment. The style was developed because auditors too often added in comments, Q-and-Aed, deviated, discussed and otherwise messed up a session.

One of these laws is Newtonâ€™s first law of motion: inertia. This is the tendency of a mest object to remain motionless until acted upon by an exterior force, or to continue in a line of motion until acted upon by an exterior force. The main force around that is continually acting on a human body is a thetan, the being himself. The body will remain at rest (since it is a mest object) until acted upon by the thetan that is supposed to be running it. If that being is an aberrated nonstraight-line being, the body reacts on him more than he reacts on the body. Thus he remains motionless or very slow. When the body is in unwanted motion, the being does not deter the motion as the body is acting upon him far more than he is reacting on the body. As a result, one of the manifestations is Q and A. He wants to pick up a piece of paper. The body inertia has to be overcome to do so. So he does not reach for the paper, he just leaves the hand where it is. This would be no action at all. If he then weakly forces the motion, he finds himself picking up something else, like a paper clip, decides he wants that anyway and settles for it.

The faster a body moves, the slower its clock runs. A minute on Earth may pass in fifty-nine seconds or sixty-one seconds on planets traveling at speeds different from that of Earth. (2) The speed of light remains constant in all frames of reference. Whether you are moving toward a light source or away from it, the light will still reach you at the same speed (186,000 miles per second). (3) All motion is relative. Therefore, there can be no such thing as absolute rest. (4) Moving bodies acquire mass as they increase in speed. The faster a body travels, the heavier it becomes. As a body approaches the speed of light, it adds mass very rapidly. If it were to reach the speed of light, its mass would become infinite. If this were true it could be seen that no body could ever travel faster than the speed of light.

They are urges for survival as or through (1) self, (2) sex and family, (3) groups, (4) all mankind, (5) living things (plants and animals), (6) the physical universe, (7) spirits, and (8) infinity or the Supreme Being. The first four of these dynamics were described and used in early Dianetics; the remaining four, although they had been known about and numbered since the beginning, came into full use with the development of Scientology. These eight dynamics embrace all the goals of survival an individual has and all the things for which he survives. The word dynamic comes from the Greek dunamis meaning â€œpower; strength.â€ Each dynamic is an energetic urge in a certain direction; the urge to survive along a certain course. They could best be represented as a series of concentric circles wherein the first dynamic would be the center and each new dynamic would be successively a circle outside it. None of these dynamics is more or less important than another. It will be found, however, among individuals that each person stresses one of the dynamics more than the others, or may stress a combination of dynamics as more important than other combinations.

It is called a â€œGoals Problem Massâ€ because it is generated by the effort on the part of the thetan to execute a goal he has postulated, which has met with opposition and hung up as a problem in terms of an identity versus another identity, creating a mass as the result of this pair banging against each other. To illustrate this, if you took two fire hoses and pointed them at each other, their streams would not reach each otherâ€™s nozzles, but would splatter against one another in midair. If this splatter were to hang there, it would be a ball of messed-up water. Call hose A the force the preclear has used to execute his goal. Call hose B the force the other dynamics have used to oppose that goal. Where these two forces have perpetually met, a mental mass is created. This is the picture of any problemâ€”force opposing force with resultant mass. Where the preclearâ€™s goal meets constant opposition, you have in the reactive mind the resultant mass caused by the two forcesâ€”goal = the force of getting it done; opposition = force opposing it getting done. The items in a Goals Problem Mass are thus the beingnesses that the person has been and has fought.

Here is an example of a harmonic in the field of music: A pitch vibrating at, let us say, 200 vibrations a second will have a harmonic at 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, etc., vibrations a second.

They might not be apparent to the ear at first listen, but almost any pitch has upper and lower harmonics. In Scientology, upper and lower harmonics refer to actions which are similar in terms of some quality or qualities, but are actually manifestations of higher or lower levels of a scale.

This opens the door to an opportunity to establish an â€œinstant opinionâ€ of the thing one is seeking to communicate. For example, one knows that an astronaut is a familiar, highly regarded being.

Another common form of Q and A is called double questioning, where the auditorâ€™s question proceeds from the preclearâ€™s last answer. Example: Preclear: â€œI never liked my father.â€ Auditor: â€œWhat about your father?â€ Pc: â€œHe was cruel.â€ Auditor: â€œWhat about cruel people?â€ Pc: â€œI donâ€™t like them.â€ Auditor: â€œWhat else donâ€™t you like?â€ And so on and on. Q and A is also encountered in administrative situations and in life in general. When the term Q and A is used, it means one did not get an answer to his question. It also means not getting compliance with an order but accepting something else. It is often used to mean indecisiveness or not making up oneâ€™s mind.

Unlike other Scientology staff, each member of the Sea Org signs a pledge of eternal service to Scientology and its goalsâ€”and thus members of this religious order form the dedicated core of the religion. The Sea Organization derives its name from its earliest beginnings in 1967 when L. Ron Hubbard, having retired from his position as Executive Director International, set to sea with a handful of veteran Scientologists to continue his research into the upper levels of spiritual awareness and ability. Although the majority of Sea Organization members are now located on land, in keeping with the tradition of the beginnings of the Sea Org, they still wear maritime uniforms and have ranks and ratings. Appropriate to their commitment of eternal service to the religion, Sea Org members bear a unique responsibility within Scientology, for they are the only Scientologists entrusted with the ministry of the advanced levels of Scientology training and auditing. All advanced churches and management-echelon Church organizations employ only members of the Sea Organization. No formalized structure exists for the Sea Org, and its lines of seniority are in accordance with the ecclesiastical hierarchy of churches.

In the case of a Scientology org a service increases the â€œusabilityâ€ of a person. â€œGood service in training and processing.â€ [HASI PL 21 Apr. 57; HCOB 5 Sept. 78; HCO PL 2 Sept. 82]'),(NULL,'Service Call-in Committee',' n. a committee in a Scientology organization that has the purpose of ensuring that call-in units for both fully and partially paid public are functional and the org is servicing the public in volume.

The service facsimile is actually part of a chain of incidents which the individual uses to invite sympathy or cooperation on the part of the environment. These computations are called â€œserviceâ€ because they â€œserveâ€ him; â€œfacsimileâ€ because they are in mental image picture form. The facsimile part is actually a self-installed disability that â€œexplainsâ€ how he is not responsible for being able to cope. For example, if the preclear well cannot achieve survival, he attempts an illness or disability as a survival computation. Then he is not wrong for not coping. The service facsimile is an action method of withdrawing from a state of beingness to a state of not-beingness and is intended to persuade others to coax the individual back into a state of beingness. Part of the â€œpackageâ€ is to be right by making others wrong.

The end phenomena of this handling is a miraculous restoration of communication between the estranged terminals, originated by the formerly antagonistic person. This rundown is for use, even after the preclear himself has been handled as a case, as it handles the other person, the SP or antagonistic person, and the preclearâ€™s relationship to him in the real physical universe. Where the SP or antagonistic person exists in present time, this rundown is done on a one-for-one basis. In such cases, it is used no matter how successful the PTS handling was.

He has never moved on up the track from thereâ€”today is that point on the track to him.

This is the level of .9 on the Tone Scale. This sympathy follows or is based upon overt action by the preclear; it is a nonsurvival apology for action against entities on any dynamic, which action has failed; and it is a mockery of actual assistance. The survival value of sympathy is this: when an individual is hurt or immobilized, he cannot fend for himself. He must count on another or others to care for him. His bid for such care is the enlistment of sympathy of others. This is practical. If men werenâ€™t sympathetic, none of us would be alive. The non-survival value of sympathy is this: an individual fails in some activity. He then considers himself incapable of surviving by himself. Even though he isnâ€™t sick actually, he makes a bid for sympathy. A psychosomatic illness is at once an explanation of failure and a bid for sympathy.

Thus, the term valence is used to denote the borrowing of the personality of another. A preclear in his fatherâ€™s valence is acting as though he were his father. A person can have two or ten dozen valences, can be one personality to Joe and another to Agnes, can change at a certain period of life into an â€œentirely new person.â€ Valence comes from the Latin word valens meaning â€œpowerfulâ€ or valentia meaning â€œstrength.â€ â€œOne person may routinely use several valences.â€ [Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health; Science of Survival; Notes on the Lectures; Handbook for Preclears; Self Analysis; Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought; Lecture 7 July 50 (#2); Lecture 8 July 50 (#1); Lecture 29 Nov. 50 (#1); Lecture 14 Jan. 55; Lecture Aug. 56; Lecture 8 Mar. 57; Lecture 17 July 57; Lecture 8 Nov. 59 (#2); Lecture 18 Oct. 61; Lecture 1 Jan. 62 (#1); Ability Major 4, July 55; PAB 83, 8 May 56; HCOB 23 Apr. 69RA I]'),(NULL,'valence, attention',' n. a valence that a person has assumed to get attention from another.
